### Welcome!

🎓 I'm a software developer from Helsinki, Finland, with 1,5 years of work experience in the field. I have studied full-stack web development at Helsinki Business College (Finland). At the moment, I study information and communication technology in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences as an Open University student. I have previously completed CS50X Introduction to Computer Science and CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python.

📝 In my Github profile, you can find assignment solutions related to my studies, as well as my final projects for the two CS50 courses I have taken. As my current job takes most of my time, I haven't been able to publish personal projects lately.
