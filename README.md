### Welcome!

🎓 I study full-stack web development at Helsinki Business College (Finland). Simultaneously, I study information and communication technology in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences as an Open University student. I have previously completed CS50X Introduction to Computer Science and CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python.

🔧 Currently I'm learning .NET framework (C# and ASP.NET), React and relational databases (SQL). I also have basic knowledge of Python and NodeJS.

📝 In my Github profile, you can find assignment solutions related to my studies, as well as my final projects for the two CS50 courses I have taken. I hope to publish more personal projects in the near future.
