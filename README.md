### Welcome!

🎓 I study full-stack web development at Helsinki Business College (Finland). Simultaneously, I take Open university courses of information and communication technology in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. I have previously completed CS50X Introduction to Computer Science and CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python.

🔧 Currently I'm learning .NET framework (C# and ASP.NET), React and relational databases (SQL). I also have basic knowledge of Python and NodeJS.

📝 In my Github you can assignment solutions related to my studies, as well as my final project for the two CS50 courses I have taken. Soon I also wish to publish more of my personal projects.
